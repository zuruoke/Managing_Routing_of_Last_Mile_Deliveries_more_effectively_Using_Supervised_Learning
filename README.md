Managing Routing of Last Mile Deliveries more Effectively using Supervised Learning

Dunzo is a Hyperlocal concierge app that provides Last Mile Delivery services in some cities of India.
They ensure that packages are delivered to the customer at a conveinent time or at a quickest possible time 

Dunzo categorizes deliveries that for some reason, relative to a destination doesn't meet the expected time for the delivery of a package,
(means that maybe the delivery personnel got stuck at a location) as unsuccessful, only then human intervention take place and 
deliveries that meet the expected time for the delivery of a package as successful

In this project I'll use a dataset containing historical samples of successful & unsucessful deliveries for the dunzo app to
build a model that predicts:

- when a delivery meets the time constraint for the delivery of a package(successfully delivered)

- when a delivery doesn't meet the time constraint for the delivery of a package 
relative to a destination (route)- the model sends a notification, only then does a human intervention take place, 
which aids in effectively managing routing of the deliveries


In this Project, I'll:

1. Prepare the data for machine learning

2. Train a model using Classifier models

3. Measure the accuracy of the model using Precision
